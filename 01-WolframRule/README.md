[Cellular Automata](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton)
====================================================================

A cellular automaton consists of a regular grid of cells, each in one of a finite number 
of states, such as on and off. One way to simulate a two-dimensional cellular automaton is with 
an infinite sheet of graph paper along with a set of rules for the cells to follow. 
Each square is called a "cell" and each cell has two possible states, black and white. 
The neighborhood of a cell is the nearby, usually adjacent, cells.
